# Inference

The inference is done in 3 phases.

1. Phase 1 (see `run_phase_1.py`): sample the posterior distribution of the single level experiments separately.
2. Phase 2 (see `run_phase_2.py`): sample the posterior distribution of the hyper parameters.
3. Phase 3 (see `run_phase_3.py`): sample theta_new.
