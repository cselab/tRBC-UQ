# Equilibration

Get to equilibrium shape for a given stress-free shape and membrane parameters.

## Quantity of interest:

Diameter D, maximum thickness hmax and minimum thickness hmin.

Measurements from Evans and Fung 1972 (all in [um]):

	D    = 7.82 \pm 0.62
	hmin = 0.81 \pm 0.35
	hmax = 2.58 \pm 0.27
